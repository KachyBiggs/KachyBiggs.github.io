    <h2>HNG 11 FIRST TASK</h2>
   <p>Hello there and welcome to my mini blog. I am Amobi Michael, a front-end developer and today I will be comparing
two front-end technolgies, we will look at their differences, performance, what makes each one better and their limitations.
</p>
<h3>REACT Js VS ANGULAR Js</h3>
<p>Comparing these two titans, both can help you build awesome web applications, but they have different strengths. So, which one's your perfect match?
</p>
<h3>REACT JS:</h3>
<p> It is a JavaScript library that keeps things simple, concentrating on building user interfaces (UI) with building blocks known as components. These components can be likened to
    inter-locking tiles that are put together to create complex interfaces. Here's why React might be your champion:<br><br>
    Speed: React is known for its speed. It uses a clever system to update only the parts of the screen that change, keeping your app animated.<br><br>
    Easy to Learn: React has a gentle learning curve, perfect for beginners. Also, there are tons of resources and a supportive community to help you out.<br><br>
    Flexibility: React plays well with others. You can use it alongside different libraries and tools to fit your project's needs.<br><br>
    Be that as it may, React has it's downside too. Since it's more lightweight, it might require you to set up some extra tools for things like routing (how users navigate your app) or managing data flow.<br></p>
<h3>ANGULAR JS:</h3>
<p>Angular is more like a one-stop shop for building web applications. It's a full-fledged framework that provides everything you need right out of the box, including routing, data management, and more. 
    Here's why Angular might be your hero:<br><br>
    Powerhouse Features: Angular is packed with built-in tools that make development faster and more structured.<br><br>
    Large Community: Angular has a massive community of developers, so finding help and resources wouldn't be a tough task.<br><br>
    Scalability: Thanks to Angular's robust architecture, building complex enterprise app have never been more easier.<br><br>
    However, Angular's strength can also be its weakness. Its all-inclusive nature can feel overwhelming for beginners, and its structure might seem less flexible for some projects.<br></p>
    <h3>SO, WHO WINS?</h3>
    <p>
        There's no one-size-fits-all answer, so:<br><br>
        Choose React if: You're new to frontend development, need a fast and flexible solution, or are working on a smaller project.<br><br>
        Choose Angular if: You need a comprehensive framework for a large-scale application, prefer a structured approach, or value a large community for support<br></p>
        <h3>EXPECTATIONS AT HNG AND REACT</h3>
        <p>Firstly, I am grateful to be part of HNG 11. I look forward to maximizing this opportunity to learn, put my skills and knowledge and skills into practice. I also
            hope to meet fellow developers and togther we can make a significant change in the world with our tech skills. Ready to put your skills to the test ? Join <a href="https://www.hng.tech/internship" target="_blank" class="link1">HNG INTERNSHIP.</a>
            Do you want to expand your horizon with HNG network ? Join <a href="https://www.hng.tech/premium" target="_blank" class="link2">HNG PREMIUM</a><br><br>
            React's focus on components and clear structure makes it a fantastic tool for beginners to learn web development fundamentals.
            But to me, the best framework is the one that helps you build what you dream of. I am ready to explore React at HNG, and ready to conquer the frontend world irrespective of the technology being used. </p>
